                        We saw many ups and downs between us, but what I'm just happy about is that we are together.
                        It might not seem that way, But you love me just in a different way. I mean everyone has his own
                        way of
                        expressing love. Saying I dont is your way of love, even the way you care is just unique.
                        Scoldings, beatings from you is your way of care towards me.
                        I mean life will be boring raa, without all these little scolding and beatings.
